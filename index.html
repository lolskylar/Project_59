                My hobby is playing different games usually alone because I have no friends :(, anyways I really like to when I get the chance. I try to do it every once and a while but it's hard when you have parents who don't approve video games even though I do coding to make video games so it makes no sense. I got this because everyone was playing them so I thought I'd try them and I instantly fell in love with the only video game at the time that was really played my girls which is Roblox and up to this date I still play it. But now I play more games then just roblox I play Among Us, Dragon City, Goozy and more. I feel like video games aren't bad but way too adicting but I still will play them because they give us some creativity which I think is really important
