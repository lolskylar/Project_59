    <h3>Roblox</h3>
    <p> So roblox is a game with many little games inside of them and is downloadable on any device. This game first went popular with little girls then later people decided that it was cool for all ages and became a game that almost all youtube gamers played and was extremely popular. So if you're playing mobile then there is a jump button and a circle with another circle inside of it, move that circle around and you will be moving the jump button will make you jump. But if you're playing PC or Macc or some type of computer, the space bar with allow you to jump as the "W" key with make you move forward. The "A" key with make you move left and the "D" key will make you move right, the "S" key with make you move downward or backward. A little trick for those wo are playing computer if you press shift them when you move your camera, usually the character would not move the way it's facing but if you use shift lock the character with move as to where your camera is facing. I think roblox is a good game and gives children some creativity as you can also make your own game in roblox if you have permission from the owner/creator of roblox, and I love how you can friend your friends and join their game as well as chat with them right on Roblox.</p>

    <h3>Among Us</h3>
    <p> Among Us is very popular at the moment. This game is downloadable on any device, but on mobile it's free as for computer it's a small amount but you still have to pay. If you're playing mobile then it's the same moving thing as the roblox mobile except there is no jump key. On computer you move your coursor to move your own self and everything else is pretty easy to learn like how to do the tasks and how to kill people when you're imposter. I think Among Us is pretty fun as you do your own tasks you vote people out and you can play with your friends by joining their game with a code at the bottom of the screen.</p>
